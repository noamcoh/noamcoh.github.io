Hi All!
A few months ago I helped my architecture student girlfriend with rendering scenes of her buildings.
At first we tried to use Unreal Engine as it has an amazing out-of-the box environmental lightning, however, soon enough we discovered that there is no free way of performing a section cut in UE5! (There is a plugin which costs a few pounds).

If you ever met an architect or an architecture student you will learn that section cuts are the bread and butter of every project, thus we needed to find a rendering engine that provides a way to perform section cuts, luckily Twinmotion which is based on UE5 is free and has this tool plus many useful tools for architects.

After she had submitted her portfolio I have decided it is time for me to explore section cuts in Unity (It works in Unreal as well).

You can read all about the solution in my [section cut project](/assets/projects/UnitySectionCuts.md)
