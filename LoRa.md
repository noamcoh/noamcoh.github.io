# Can LoRa be used for a mars rover?
During my studies in Uni we were asked to design and build a small scale mars rover.
The part that I invested most of my time into was commuincation.
I wanted to check if LoRa[Long Range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LoRa) could be used to commuincate with a mars rover.
This led me to quite a side quest (which expanded way beyond my study hours).
I summarised the research here in a report.
