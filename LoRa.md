Can LoRa be used for a mars rover?
During my studies in Uni we were asked to design and build a small scale mars rover.
The part that I invested most of my time into was commuincation, I wanted to check if LoRa(Long Range) could be used to commuincate with a mars rover.
This led me to quite a side quest, which I summarised here in a report.
